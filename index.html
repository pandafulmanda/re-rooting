                    <p>I ask myself, why put this out there?  I've always talked to myself. Why share now...what gives? Who cares?</p>
                    <p>I'm private by nature &amp; nuture.</p>
                    <p>Growing up, I felt trapped. I fought back in little, silly ways to be free.</p>
                    <p>The funny thing is, once I gained agency, I found my own ways to trap myself -- the wrong boys, imagined expectations, work, and so on. Now, with these shared ramblings, I hope to be exposed, to unmoor more of myself, to not shrink back.</p>
                    <p>These words are just wanderers; may these words never find an anchor.</p>
                    <p>They're are just bits and bytes afterall, a shout in the void! At the very least, I'm shouting and using my given lungs.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">i must remember: you are a body. you are a mind.</p><p>you are a voice!</p>

                    <p>As a perennial workaholic, I'm here to challenge myself to live outside my work.</p>

                    <p>I am an infant again.</p>
                    <p>Lately, I spend time in nature with other people. These wise souls point at life and say things like,</p>
                    <p>"These frogfruit are native to this area and provide great ground-cover." and <br/>"What services does this willow provide?"</p>
                    <p>My eyelids are barely starting to peel open. I blink in awe. I taste the air. I listen. I grasp at stems and leaves.</p>
                    <p>I should be babbling soon.</p>
                    <p>I plan to link out here to different projects related to nature in the coming weeks (2023-05-06).</p>

                    <p>More and more, I find myself using and abusing my trusty aluminum steed, <a href="https://www.prioritybicycles.com/products/priority-apollo" target="_blank">a 2021 Priority Apollo</a>, attentively tended to by the wonderful team at Eado Bike Co.</p>
                    <p>I am planning some trips and longer rides that I hope to share parts of here.</p>

                    <p>Summer of 2022: I grind into an impasse in my mind. I was burned out.  I was depressed.</p>
