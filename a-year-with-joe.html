                                On a cool, crisp, fall morning — a refreshing oasis in the lingering Houston heat — I meet Joe Jones. Joe has been painting the window signs at Neighbors, a bar in my neighborhood.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                He talks about how he drafts his designs on paper, makes holes along his lines, and then, holding the design up on the window, he brushes baby powder through the holes. When he removes the paper from the window, he can see his design by the traces of baby powder.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                “You know who came up with that? Michelangelo, he did it for the Sistine Chapel,”  he shares. He talks about intent, and freehand painting, and being a sign-painter all over Houston, way way back, when what are now decals on trucks would be hand-painted, with gold-leaf applied for flourish.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                The deep, warm timbre of his voice and melodic cadence of his speech transports me to a more colorful time. He’s painted signs downtown, in the Heights, in Montrose, in River Oaks, for clients big and small, restaurants, cafes, bars…signs I've used to guide me without knowing the hand behind them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Joe sees my bike and his eyes light up. We talk bikes for a good hour or so. He loves to bike around, leisurely, sometimes carting his supplies with him. We talk about the rush rush of the times of today, the obnoxious, tiring, incessant drum of capitalism.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I am not ready to leave him, but I am also itching to be on my way. And so, I steal a few more moments, and then I say goodbye and pedal away.
                                </p>

                                    Neeraj, Joe and I are hanging out at Neighbors again. Joe had been gone, unreachable for months. Neeraj and I are not sure why at the time. Later, I’ll piece together the maze of Joe’s medical conditions and learn that he had a pretty serious fall and hospital stay. 
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                <p>
                                    I snap some photos of Joe painting. Joe says he feels like he’s reaching a point of recognition just as he’s facing old age. “Isn’t that strange?” he muses.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It comes time for him to go home. He talks about taking the bus. I insist on driving him back, and taking Neeraj with us. Something about Joe’s demeanor pulls me in. I can sense that Joe really wants to show us his place and belongings.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We follow Joe up a flight of slippery stairs. We enter. Our eyes adjust to the darkness and we see a crowded world of wonder, set up as an artist studio by Joe, for Joe: foam sculpting tools, drafting tables, his creations and shelves of art books. His bike with a hand-painted sign hung in the frame – Joe Jones, Sign Painter and Artist. No couch, no bed. Joe watches us pore over his books, his signs, his tools.
                                </p>

                                    When we set foot into your apartment, we became something else, someone else to you.

                                    You call me “sis.” I am at a loss for words. To gain a brother such as you, I am incredibly touched. A chosen family, and yet we do have so much shared in our composition: the spirals pedaled by our feet along the bayous, the yearning in our hands for colors and craft, the twinkle in our eyes whenever we meet young souls.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You were not far in time and space, and yet, we did not become family until now. Now, when your hands and your muscles are unwiring from your mind.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As modern people, we chase time, wish for time-travel, long to master time. When I…or anyone really, sit next to you, we sit next to seventy-eight years of a life hard-lived, well-lived, seventy-eight years that I have a deep window into, seventy-eight years that you so lovingly share.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A precious life. My precious brother.

                                <p>
                                    You tell me to come sit with you during one of your dialysis appointments. You have me feel the warmth of your blood through the polypropylene tubes. I feel an itch in my nose, and an ache in my eyes. Why, why, why are you inside out?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You shake your head with anger at this mechanical, clinical process called dialysis, how strange a thing it is for the human body to experience.

                                    Sometimes it feels like I make you do so many things. I put on a brave face and say, Joe! <a class="audio-clip" href="#chicken-fried-steak">What will we eat today!</a> knowing full well this is just a game we play, where I put on a show eating with my outsized appetite, trying through osmosis to infect you to eat more than 3 bites. I become sensitive to the design of places, how you labor to make it to the front door, how you put on a show for me as if to say — see, I’m strong, I’m walking well, please sis, don't baby me. You are proud, stubborn, sovereign: like my mom, like me. It’s a dance each day, how much you let me help you, how much I let you suffer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It’s all so senseless. You’ve already fought so much, as a child in your multiple foster homes, and then overseas, enlisting in the Vietnam war to escape the abuse of your foster mother. And then through your many lives, working in restaurants, construction, oil and gas…your idealism clashing against the pains of the human world: cheating, waste, people with money, numbing their pains, running with scissors.  And here you are, fighting the multiple organ failures in your body.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Through our routine drives to and from dialysis, I get to know your neighborhood through your eyes: who has nice flowers in their yard, where to get the freshest fried seafood, where to find <a class="audio-clip" href="#bike-tree">the tree with a bike grown into the trunk</a>, where you made friends — the gardener on the corner of Heights and East 14th, the grocers working at the Kroger on West 20th, <a class="audio-clip" href="#goat">the goat that once guarded a property behind Connie’s on Calvacade</a>. I discover your quirks: <a class="audio-clip" href="#kroger-lotto">your love and absolute dedication to buying PowerBall numbers two times a week!</a> your uncontrollable craving for anything sweet and sugary, your love of mischief through your <a class="audio-clip" href="#roach">reenactment of Neeraj’s fear of cockroaches in his car – “Joe, Joe, ah! You kill it!”</a>
                                </p>

                                    We drive by White Oak Bayou often. We both dream of a day when we might bike it together. We never say this wish out loud.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The next several months are a blur. We walk up and down your stairs, to and from the car, some days effortless, some days, you grimace in pain with each step. We sit in traffic. You catch all my wrong turns and laugh when I duck cops after I get two tickets driving with you. We sit outside your apartment, talking for hours. We are in and out of the emergency room. We take you to appointments with this specialist and that specialist. You are somehow at least 5 separate ailing body parts to the system. After a CAT scan one day, a technician tells me in earnest, “You’re doing a good thing.”
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    I think of all the times I could’ve done something different, all the times I could’ve gotten Joe to more extensive care sooner, or could’ve been firmer with Joe about his appointments, upsetting him and his trust, but extending his life, by months…bed-bound as he may have been.
                                </p>

                                    I am called your caregiver. I am not trained for this. I am steeped in anxiety. Am I performing some kind of malpractice? I chase after your medical history through the red tape, the disjointed health care system, deciphering and decoding technical jargon, insurance claims and bills. So many bills.

                                    Every now and then, Joe tells me he’s been down before, but he always catches a big break, a second-wind. We see this in real-time: Each time you seem really broken, each time we think it really might be time for us to convince you to accept hospice, you bounce back with vigor. You oscillate between thoughts of death to dreams of riding a <a class="audio-clip" href="#purpose">motorcycle again to Galveston beach</a>.

                                    Sometimes, I ponder the timing of my entering into his life as he’s on his last leg. Am I his grim reaper? His Charon, here to ferry him to the underworld after collecting a coin? His xolo dog walking with him to his death?

                                    Might I see you through just another month, another week, another day?

                                    Suddenly, and not suddenly, it happens. I walk into your shell of a home and find your shell of a body on your kitchen floor. Just like that, you are gone. In the hours and days that follow, we enter into the mechanics of death in America: I make some calls, I watch your body get examined by strangers, more calls, more strangers come to put you in a bag. I watch them walk you down your apartment stairs one final time, to a van. To a holding place for your body, until the time has expired for any living blood relatives to come forward, and they say, okay, it’s time to process your body.
                                </p>

                                    We begin to work through your apartment, your belongings. In your art I see your hands. In your supplies I see your mind. Heaps of paper, foam, construction signs, a wealth of materials you collected from wasteful, corporate hands. You had grand designs for them, plans to breathe new life into them…all pointing back to our first conversation about capitalism, modernity, neglect, and how to cope, how to find the beauty in it all.
                                </p>

                                    In your bike bag I find a seashell I know you found on Galveston beach to keep with you. I take it with me and put it in my bike bag.

                                    I don’t know why I came here. I didn’t leave my house ever thinking I would come here.

                                    Here where you were trapped on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays during the last five years of your life. I wish I hadn’t brought you to these machines during your last year. I wish I had let you play hooky more.
                                </p>

                                    Inside this building, you sat for hours and hours, your blood streaming through miles and miles of a foreign plastic path. I wonder, did your blood cells ever travel more in length in those tubes than you’ve traveled in your lifetime? Did they travel more than what we’ve traveled together? More than your hands got to travel over papers and windows coming alive with your art?

                                    When did you fall in love with art? How did you come to start sign painting?

                                    I leave here, bike home. I know there were many times when you longed to do the same.

We will take your ashes to places where you wore your heart on your sleeves – Galveston, Las Vegas, Philly, Vietnam, Thailand, and finally, your birthplace – New York City.
